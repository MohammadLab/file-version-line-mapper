# Simple Line Mapper Test - Modified Version

1. Initialize the working directory.        # wording change
2. Scan all files recursively.
3. For each file, read every line into memory.
4. Normalize line endings to UNIX style.
5. Ignore empty lines and pure whitespace.
6. Trim trailing spaces on each line.       # new inserted line
7. Build a hash for every non-empty line.
8. Store mappings: (relative_path, line_number, hash).  # edited
9. Sort lines by hash, then by file name.
10. Group identical hashes into candidate matches.
11. Try to align nearby lines using a window of 5.       # edited detail
12. Emit a JSON report with all mappings.
13. Print detailed statistics to stdout.                 # edited
14. Exit with code 0 on success.

# Notes

- This modified file is intentionally small.
- It is used to test:
  - unchanged lines
  - slightly edited lines and comments
  - inserted lines
  - deleted lines
  - moved bloc
  ks of text

# Future ideas

- Add support for:
  - ignoring comments and docstrings          # edited
  - fuzzy matching for small edits
  - grouping by functions, classes, or regions # edited
- Consider a CLI flag for verbose logging.     # new
