# Simple Line Mapper Test - Base Version

1. Initialize the repository directory.
2. Scan all files recursively.
3. For each file, read every line into memory.
4. Normalize line endings to UNIX style.
5. Ignore empty lines and pure whitespace.
6. Build a hash for every non-empty line.
7. Store mappings: (file, line_number, hash).
8. Sort lines by hash, then by file name.
9. Group identical hashes into candidate matches.
10. For each candidate group, attempt to align nearby lines.
11. Emit a JSON report with all mappings.
12. Print basic statistics to stdout.
13. Exit with code 0 on success.

# Notes

- This base file is intentionally simple.
- It is used to test:
  - unchanged lines
  - slightly edited lines
  - inserted lines
  - deleted lines
  - moved blocks of text

# Future ideas

- Add support for:
  - ignoring comments
  - fuzzy matching for small edits
  - grouping by functions or classes
